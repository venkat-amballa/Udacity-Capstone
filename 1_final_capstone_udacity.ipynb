        "3. Datasets and Inputs\n",
        "\n",
        "Dataset details:\n",
        "The dataset is comprised of 5 static gestures (hand poses) captured for 12 users using a Vicon motion capture camera system and a glove with attached infrared markers on certain joints. A rigid pattern on the back of the glove was used to establish a translation and rotation invariant local coordinate system. The five gestures captured were fist, pointing with one finger, pointing with two fingers, stop (handflat), and grab (fingers curled). Several hundred instances of each gesture were captured as part of streams. where the user held the gesture for a short time. Instances were preprocessed by removing all markers more than 200mm from the origin and transforming to local coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "The markers on the back of the glove was used to establish a local coordinate system for the hand, and 11 other markers were attached to the thumb and fingers of the glove. 3 markers were attached to the thumb with one above the thumbnail and the other two on the knuckles. 2 markers were attached to each finger with one above the fingernail and the other on the joint between the proximal and middle phalanx. \n",
        "\n",
        "The 11 markers not part of the rigid pattern were unlabeled; their positions were not explicitly tracked. Consequently, there is no a priori correspondence between the markers of two given records. In addition, due to the resolution of the capture volume and self-occlusion due to the orientation and configuration of the hand and fingers, many records have missing markers. Extraneous markers were also possible due to artifacts in the Vicon software's marker reconstruction/recording process and other objects in the capture volume. As a result, the number of visible markers in a record varied considerably. \n",
